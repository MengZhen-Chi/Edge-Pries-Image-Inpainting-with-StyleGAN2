## üñºÔ∏è Overview

This project aims to perform image restoration from damaged inputs, guided by edge or sketch contours. We provide inference scripts and pretrained weights on FFHQ for generating high quality results at 256 resolutions. We also provide the edge maps of FFHQ and CelebA-HQ, you can use the pretrained weights and edge maps to evaluate the FID and Lpips scores on CelebA-HQ or other face images.
